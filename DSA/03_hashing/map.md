# Frequency Count of Characters in a String

## Traditional Approach to Count Frequency of Characters

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    vector<int> v(26, 0);
    string word;
    cin >> word;

    for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++)
    {
        v[word[i] - 'a']++;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
    {
        cout << (char)(i + 'a') << " " << v[i] << endl;
    }

    cout << endl << "From map" << endl;

    map<char, int> char_freq;
    for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++)
    {
        char_freq[word[i]]++;
    }

    for (auto it : char_freq)
    {
        cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- The traditional approach uses a vector of size 26 to count the frequency of each character.
- This approach is not optimal as it uses a fixed-size array, which is not feasible for large ranges (e.g., numbers up to 10^9).

### Optimal Approach Using Hashing
- Hashing is used to count the frequency of characters optimally.
- It takes O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity in the worst case, where n is the size of the string.

### Methods for Hashing
1. `unordered_map`
2. `map`

## Using `map` to Count Frequency of Characters Optimally

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string word;
    cin >> word;

    map<char, int> char_freq;
    for (int i = 0; i < word.size(); i++)
    {
        char_freq[word[i]]++;
    }

    for (auto it : char_freq)
    {
        cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
    }
}
```

## Comparison: `unordered_map` vs `map`

| Feature | `unordered_map` | `map` |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Implementation | Hashing | Self-balancing binary search tree |
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Time Complexity (Insertion, Deletion, Searching) | O(1) | O(logn) |
| Order | Not ordered | Ordered |
| Use Case | When order is not needed | When order is needed |

### Use Cases
- `unordered_map`: Finding frequency of elements, checking presence, finding max/min element, etc.
- `map`: Maintaining order, finding elements in range, etc.

### Additional Considerations
- The traditional approach is not optimal as it uses a 26-size array. When counting the frequency of numbers, it may go up to a size of 10^9, which is not feasible. In the main block, we can go up to 10^6, and globally we can go up to 10^7. Similarly, in the case of boolean, we can go up to 10^7 in the main block and 10^8 globally.
